Crop Monitoring System
======================

This is a Python web application that allows farmers to remotely monitor their crops. It provides features such as real-time sensor data, weather forecasts, pest detection, and crop health analytics.

Features
--------

*   Weather forecast using OpenWeatherMap API
*   Real-time sensor data simulation (soil moisture, temperature, humidity, light intensity)
*   Pest alert system
*   Crop health analytics

Prerequisites
-------------

*   Python 3.7+
*   Flask
*   Requests library

Installation
------------

1.  Clone this repository:
    
        git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crop-monitoring-system.git
        cd crop-monitoring-system
        
    
2.  Install the required packages:
    
        pip install flask requests
        
    
3.  Set up your OpenWeatherMap API key:
    
    *   Sign up for a free account at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)
    *   Get your API key from your account dashboard
    *   Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` in `app.py` with your actual API key

Usage
-----

1.  Run the application:
    
        python app.py
        
    
2.  Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`
    
3.  The dashboard will display weather forecasts, sensor data, pest alerts, and crop health information.
    

Customization
-------------

*   To change the monitored city, update the `CITY` variable in `app.py`
*   Modify the simulated sensor data, pest alerts, and crop health data in `app.py` to match your specific needs

Future Improvements
-------------------

*   Integrate with real sensor data APIs
*   Implement user authentication and authorization
*   Add more detailed analytics and reporting features
*   Incorporate machine learning models for pest detection and crop health predictions
*   Implement push notifications for critical alerts
